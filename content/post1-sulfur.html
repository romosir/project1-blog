            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p><i><b>Sulfur</b> is an essential element for all life, but almost always in the form of organosulfur compounds or metal sulfides</i></p>

            <p>Though sometimes found in pure, native form, sulfur on Earth usually occurs as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Being abundant in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times, being mentioned for its uses in ancient <u>India</u>, ancient <u>Greece</u>, <u>China</u>, and ancient <u>Egypt</u>. Historically and in literature sulfur is also called <b>brimstone</b>, which means "burning stone".
            </p>

            <h3>Characteristics</h3>

            <p><b>Sulfur</b> is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide and, to a lesser extent, in other nonpolar organic solvents, such as benzene and toluene.</p>

            <h3>Chemical properties</h3>

            <p>In reactions with elements of lesser electronegativity, it reacts as an oxidant and forms sulfides, where it has oxidation state â€“2.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>Being abundantly available in native form, sulfur was known in ancient times and is referred to in the Torah (Genesis).</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Shawna_Vogel">
                <p>Researchers believed that sulfur dioxide emitted by volcanoes would turn into sulfuric acid in the stratosphere, creating a haze of acid droplets that would block the sun's rays and keep them from warming the air below.
